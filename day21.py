# Q: What is the difference between Traditional programming and ML 
"""
The main difference in traditional programming and machine learning is that
in traditional programming the user has to set the rules of how the data is
treated to produce output, meaning other than calclulations most of the 
process is decided by the user.
Whereas in ML, the algorithm learns the rules based on previous data,
saving the limited human resources(user) to do other tasks where it's more needed.
